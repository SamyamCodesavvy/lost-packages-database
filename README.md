This SQL program is designed to answer six specific questions regarding three distinct scenarios: The Lost Letter, The Devious Delivery, and The Forgotten Gift. Each section in the program corresponds to one of these scenarios and includes SQL queries to retrieve relevant data from the database.

## Purpose
The purpose of this program is to analyze a database containing information about addresses, packages, scans, and drivers in order to provide answers to the following questions:

1. At what type of address did the Lost Letter end up?
2. At what address did the Lost Letter end up?
3. At what type of address did the Devious Delivery end up?
4. What were the contents of the Devious Delivery?
5. What are the contents of the Forgotten Gift?
6. Who has the Forgotten Gift?
   
## Each Scenario
### The Lost Letter
The Lost Letter scenario aims to identify the address where a particular package, referred to as the Lost Letter, ended up.

### The Devious Delivery
The Devious Delivery scenario aims to identify the type of address where a suspicious delivery ended up and retrieve information about its contents.

### The Forgotten Gift
